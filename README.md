# WebRTC Video Conference Tutorial

This tutorial is divided in three versions:

* Plain WebRTC (One to One)
* WebRTC using Media Server (Many to Many)
* WebRTC using CPaaS (Many to Many)

Each version lives on its own branch so you can checkout to each one to review them.

    git checkout webrtc     // for one to one webrtc tutorial
    git checkout kurento    // for webrtc using media server
    git checkout tokbox     // for webrtc using CPaaS

As you can see we're using [Kurento](http://www.kurento.org/) as media server and [Tokbox](https://tokbox.com/) as CPaaS service.
